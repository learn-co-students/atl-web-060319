## Mod 2 Week 2

* Tuesday:
  * Rails Development Process
  * Strong Params
  * `form_for` and `collection_select`
  * Bonus: Displaying errors. Maybe the flash?
  * FSP at 4:30!

## Rails CRUD

### Deliverables

* A code school app with cohorts and students.
  * Cohorts have new/create/index/show.
  * Students need new/create/edit/update/destroy.

### Learning Objectives

* `localhost:3000/rails/info/routes`
* Practice with Rails path helpers, link_to, redirect.
  * (vs manually constructing anchor tags)
* Practice using resources for routing.
* Explain the need for strong params.
* Distinguish between raw form vs form_tag vs form_for (mention form_with).
* What the hell is a "view helper"?
