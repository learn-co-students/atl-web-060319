### To Build...

A tiny library.

<!-- * make a wonderful homepage -->
<!-- * list all the books -->
<!-- * get info on a single book -->
<!-- * add a book to the library -->
<!-- * have a page for listing authors in the library -->
<!-- * have a form for adding an author and several of their books at once! -->
<!-- * Separate authors and books -->
   * Add author model and migrate books to have an author_id
   * Add a form for creating an author and several books at the same time

## Waking Up

* Break our routes into separate controllers to keep the code organized!

* Let's fix the add book form to let us pick from the existing authors with a dropdown.

## Editing & Validations

* It would be nice to be able to edit a book. Let's add this so at least one controller supports the full set of RESTful routes.

* Now add some validations. Does saving always work?
  * How can we improve the user experience if a record doesn't save?
