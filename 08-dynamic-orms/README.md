# More ORMs + OO Review

## Timeline

* 25 minutes - What is bad about our ORM? How can we fix it?

* 35 minutes - Review Many to Many relationships.


### A more dynamic ORM

NOTE: This is not code you should be able to reproduce,
but valuable for you to have a sense of how it works.
Doing so will help you better use and debug issues with
real world ORMs such as ActiveRecord, SQLAlchemy, etc.

### Many to Many Review

### Domain

- this app will mimic an online album review site, like you might find on allmusic.com or last.fm

- the models will be `users`, `albums`, and `reviews`

- a user has many reviews, an album has many reviews, and a review belongs to a user and an album

### Models

`User` - has many reviews  
`Review` - belongs to user and belongs to album  
`Album` - has many reviews

### Notes

As this is a review for Friday's code challenge, we will be working with an environment consisting of pry, a few other gems and the terminal. There will be **no tests** like there are in the labs. `config/environment.rb` is set up so that each of the files in the 'app' directory are connected to one another. Seed Data will be placed in `tools/console.rb`, directly before `Pry` is executed. This way, all of your classes will have loaded and instances initialized by the time the repl opens. To run your code, simply enter `tools/console.rb` in the terminal.
