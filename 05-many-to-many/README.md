# Many to Many Relationships

Today, we're going to build a twitter-ish app with the ability for users to like tweets.

We describe this specific relationship between users and tweets as a many to many relationship. Meaning that a user can like many tweets and a tweet can be liked by many users!

> **Note:** This is a separate relationship from the one to many that we built before.

## Deliverables

* User class
  * `#like_tweet` that accepts as a tweet instance as a parameter
  * `#liked_tweets` that returns a collection of all the tweets this user has liked
* Tweet class
  * `#likers` that returns a collection of all the Users who have liked this tweet
